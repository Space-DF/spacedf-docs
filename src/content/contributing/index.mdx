## 🚦 Quick Rules for Contributors

To keep the project healthy, please follow these simple rules:

1.  **Atomic Commits:** Keep your Pull Requests focused. One feature/fix per PR is easier to review.
2.  **Tagging:** If you are working on a service, ensure your tag follows our `X.Y.Z` SemVer policy.
3.  **Tests:** Ensure that your changes do not break the integration tests in `spacedf-core`.
