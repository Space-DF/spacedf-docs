# Device Management

This guide provides an overview of managing LoRaWAN devices within SpaceDF, from registration to monitoring and configuration.

## Device Registration

### Adding New Devices

You can register devices in SpaceDF using multiple methods:

- **Device Information:** Enter the device EUI and configuration details.
- **Device Templates:** Apply pre-configured templates for common device types to speed up setup.
- **Bulk Import:** Import multiple devices using CSV files.
- **API Integration:** Programmatically register devices via API endpoints.

Adding devices is a necessary step at both the **Organization Site** and the **Space Site**.
