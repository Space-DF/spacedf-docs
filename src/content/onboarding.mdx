# Onboarding Guide

This step-by-step guide will help you set up your first SpaceDF organization, add devices, and start tracking your assets.

## 1. Create Your Account

To get started, create a free account using your email, name, and password. You can also sign up quickly with your Google or Apple account.

<img

  alt="Create Account"
/>
This will be for the **Admin** - this login will have permissions to perform operations
in the account.

[**Sign up for SpaceDF →**](https://spacedf.com/en/auth/sign-up)

Once you create your SpaceDF account, your workspace will be generated automatically. From here, you can manage and view all your organizations in one place.

## 2. Create Your First Organization

An organization acts as the main container for your locations, devices, and users, helping you manage everything in a structured way.

**Steps:**

1. **Add a New Organization**: Click the "Add Organization" button in your workspace

2. **Fill in Required Information**:
   - **Organization Name**: Enter your organization name
   - **Organization Slug Name**: Auto-generated (unchangeable after creation)
