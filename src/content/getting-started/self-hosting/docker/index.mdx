## Prerequisites

- [Basic Linux](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/linux-commands) server usage (connecting to a server, running commands).
- How Docker and Docker Compose work at a high level.
- Basic networking concepts such as [ports](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-computer-port) and [firewalls](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/what-is-a-firewall/)

If you are unsure which path to choose, start with **Quick Start**. You can move to **Advanced Setup** at any time.
