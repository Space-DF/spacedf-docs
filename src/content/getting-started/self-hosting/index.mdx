# Self-Hosting

Install and run your own SpaceDF platform on your computer, server, or cloud infrastructure.

## Get started

The fastest and recommended way to self-host SpaceDF platform is using Docker.

## About self-hosting

Self-hosting SpaceDF is a suitable choice when you want to run the system on your own infrastructure instead of relying on third-party services. This approach gives you full ownership of your data, allows you to meet internal or legal compliance requirements, and lets you operate SpaceDF in a private or isolated environment.

### What Self-Hosted SpaceDF Is (and Is Not)

Running SpaceDF in a self-hosted setup means that you install, run, and manage the platform yourself.

It is not the same as:

- Using a local setup for development or testing purposes only
- Using a fully managed or hosted version where infrastructure and maintenance are handled for you

### Data and Telemetry

SpaceDF does not automatically send usage data, metrics, or telemetry to external services when running in a self-hosted environment. All data remains within the infrastructure you control.

### Your Responsibilities When Self-Hosting

When you choose to self-host SpaceDF, you take responsibility for operating the system. This includes:

- Setting up and maintaining the server or hosting environment
- Applying security updates and keeping the operating system and services up to date
- Managing the database used by SpaceDF
- Creating and maintaining backups, and planning for recovery in case of failures
- Monitoring system health, performance, and availability
